- My Project name is Task Manager

- The technologies that I have used during this project was microsoft copilot.

- This Porgram starts off with the user inputting a task that they need to do. After they do this the front page will include the most recent tasks they have put into the program. The second page will show them a lift of their tasks that they have inputted fromn the earliest to the oldest. The last page includes every single task they have completed whilst using the program no matter how small.

- The future improvments I would add is more pictures to want the user to come back to the page.
